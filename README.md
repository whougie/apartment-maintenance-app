# Group Project: Apartment Maintainence App

## Overview Description
Welcome to The Exception.

We are tasked by a real estate firm to create a website to monitor their apartment complexes.



## Group Project - Acceptance Criteria

 Project Requirements
You will build a web application, the subject is yours to choose, that meets the following criteria:

You will decide on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) . You don't need to clear it with the instructors before starting; but you're welcome to.
Use a Kanban board (Trello is good) or Github Project to track what tasks everyone is working on.
It uses semantically correct HTML, with at least one page generated from the server via Handlebars.
It uses Bootstrap or some CSS library, along with custom CSS you write. The site must have a RESPONSIVE design.
jQuery or vanilla Javascript must be used for client-side code

Express must be used, with an MVC file structure.
Postgres and Sequelize must be used.
Your database should have a minimum of three tables (one of which would be a users table), and associations among these tables. Users should be able to perform at least GET and POST functions on your models.
The User table should include a field for a hashed password.
One or more pages must be restricted to only logged-in users.

Must have a signup and login form 
Seeding is recommended but not required
Must use at least one new technology, library, etcâ€¦ This can be a third-party Javascript library or Node package, or an external API of some sort.
All code must clean and well-organized, with good file structure 

No obvious bugs, no errors in dev console or terminal
Frequent code commits by all members 

The README file will be well-organized and have:
Project description
Team members 
Screen shot(s)
Link to deployed version on Render 
Final code must be deployed to Render 
Only one repo needs to be managed per group. 


## The presentation:
It will last about 10-15 minutes
It will be accompanied by a Google Slides doc 
Every group member will have a turn at speaking
You will discuss:
Your initial idea and the MVP you decided on
Your tech stack
Challenges you faced 
Things which went right; things you struggled with 
Ideas for expansion
Quick demo of the working site

## Final submission:
Each member will submit a link to the shared repo, and to the Render
(All members will be submitting the same two links)
Each member will also grade their teammates on a scale of 1 to 5 for the following:
Participation
Willingness to take on difficult work
Reliability
These grades will be seen ONLY by instructional staff
